// NOTE: console.log prints text to the browser console that you can enable
//       to see the output. It is a little bit more convenient than alert so
//       we will use it most of the time.

//    than n (this means n is a parameter for the function). Before you write
//    the implementation of the function, first create some tests that will
//    eventually show that your function works correctly.
